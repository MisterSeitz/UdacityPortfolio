**Udacity Portfolio Website** is the second project in Udacity's "Full Stack Web Developer" Nanodegree 

## Project Overview (As Specified by Udacity)
For this project, you'll be building a portfolio website. You will be provided a design mockup as a PDF-file, and you must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. You will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects you will complete through the course of your Nanodegree program. Please note that while you should aim to recreate the mockup, you may also use your own custom images to personalize this project.

Once you've successfully replicated the design mockup, you are encouraged to continue tweaking and making customizations to the design to personalize it and make it your own! This is your living portfolio site, so make sure you're happy with it.

### Project Details:
  - The Project is meant to be replicated from a mockup PDF file found at: `https://storage.googleapis.com/supplemental_media/udacityu/2655898586/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf`
  - The website is supposed to be responsive on differently sized viewports.
  - In order to achieve the responsiveness effectively I have used 4 separate CSS files which is specified in the <head> section of index.html and also listed at the beginng of this README.
  - 2 of the project links, namely 'Item Catalogue' and 'Neighbourhood Map' are future projects as specified in the Nanodegree syllabus and hence are not available but provided for nonetheless.
